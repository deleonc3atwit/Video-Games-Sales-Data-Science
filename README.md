# Video Game Sales Data Science Project 


## Introduction
The objective of this project was to take is to take data regarding video games sales from 1980 to 2016 and analyze it to see what factors in to the average successful video game. To do this we put ourselves in the shoes of up and coming game developers who want to develop a financial successful video game. 

As prospective game developers we want to know what genres, platforms, and publishers yield the highest video games sales. To find the best factors for each category we use python and the data science skills we learned this semester to analyze our data set. 

Given my knowledge and experience with this market as a gamer I hypothisized that shooters and actions games would be top contenders for the highest selling genres. I also hypothesized that Sonyâ€™s Playstation 4 will probably be the highest selling platform, but Microsofts Xbox One sales would still probably be comparable to its Sony competitor. For the highest selling publishers I hypothesized with less certainty that it may be either Activision or Electonic Arts.



## Selection of Data
We source our dataset from a website called Kaggle that hosts various datasets ranging across various topics. Our data set has various columns  of data such as name, platform, year of release, genre, publisher, sales for various regions, critics score, number of critics, users score, number of users, developer, and maturity rating. The data most relevant to us as prospective game developers are the global sales, publisher, genre, and year of release.

Here is a preview of our data(year of release not displayed for readability)

## Methods
Tools:
- Seaborn, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data analysis and vizualiztion 
- Pycharm  as IDE

Vizualization methods used with Matplotlib and Seaborn:
- Scatterplot
- Lineplot(Conley Deleon)
