# Video Game Sales Data Science Project 


## Introduction
The objective of this project was to take is to take data regarding video games sales from 1980 to 2016 and analyze it to see what factors in to the average successful video game. To do this we put ourselves in the shoes of up and coming game developers who want to develop a financial successful video game. 

As prospective game developers we want to know what genres, platforms, and publishers yield the highest video games sales. To find the best factors for each category we use python and the data science skills we learned this semester to analyze our data set. 

Given my knowledge and experience with this market as a gamer I hypothisized that shooters and actions games would be top contenders for the highest selling genres. I also hypothesized that Sonyâ€™s Playstation 4 will probably be the highest selling platform, but Microsofts Xbox One sales would still probably be comparable to its Sony competitor. For the highest selling publishers I hypothesized with less certainty that it may Activision or Electonic Arts may be some of the highest selling publishers.
